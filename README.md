# CarpoolVT-Website
This is the README Document for the Carpool VT WordPress Website. This document's purpose is to better explain the website we made and how to view the code. We created a website with wordpress.com and once of WP’s many useful plugins called Elementor Pro. Elementor Pro is a workflow tool that better enables the programmer to more efficiently develop websites from its unique interface. Elementor pro allows for the developer to drag and drop certain features that allow the user to write CSS to better style said features.  
I am now going to go through each folder in the .zip file and their index.hmtl files that contain the written code for each webpage.  
Json and includes folder 
	All of these files were generated from WordPress and elementor and help with the basic functionality of certain features including the login, and form submission on the “Get More FAQs” “ask us a question” form.  
Content > uploads > elementor > css 
	All of these files include the CSS files that we had written to better style the website and features.  
View Private Policy 
	This folder’s index.html file is the html file for the “view private policy page”. This page doesn’t service much of a purpose functionality wise, but we felt that it was important to include. This is because in this new age of information privacy it is important to be transparent with users about how their information is being processed when they visit a website. 
Schedule a ride 
	The index.html file here is for the “Schedule a ride” webpage. It mostly consisting of text field forms to enter information and a Google map widget where the user can get directions somewhere. We weren’t able to fully develop the back-end of the website to actually schedule people’s carpool rides given the limited time in the semester. 
Feed 
	This index.html file here are for the header and footers that you see on each page. 
Home 
	The index.html file here contains the html code for the home, and all other pages that we have for the website. This includes the “Get more faqs”, “login”, and “View Account” Pages.
